### Welcome, (future) tech lead!

And welcome to the journey into leadership. Becoming a great tech lead, senior software engineer, architect, principal engineer, whatever you want to call it, takes time and practice. 

Use these open source workshops to help you develop skills before you need them.

You can read about leadership and study it all you want, but you won't get real practice until real leadership moments come up. Leadership is like public speaking in that way -- the only way to get good is to practice.
