### First, Choose a Case Study:

**[Sprint Planning Impasse](/case-studies/sprint-planning-impasse.html)** You're the tech lead in a spring planning meeting with five software engineers. Your engineering manager relies on you and wants some kind of prototype at the end of this sprint, but the other senior engineer in the room refuses to write a line of code until all the design and architecture is done. What will you do now?

**[Welcome to the Team](/case-studies/new-on-the-job.html)** This workshop explores a common, ambiguous work situation. You are a new, junior software engineer on a team at a big company. Work through the ambiguity to find moments to lead, get some results, and improve your engineering team's culture and effectiveness.

### And Now, Welcome, (Future) Tech Lead!

And welcome to the journey into leadership. Becoming a great tech lead, senior software engineer, architect, principal engineer, whatever you want to call it, takes time and practice. 

Use these open source workshops to help you develop skills before you need them.

You can read about leadership and study it all you want, but you won't get real practice until real leadership moments come up. Leadership is like public speaking in that way -- the only way to get good is to practice.
