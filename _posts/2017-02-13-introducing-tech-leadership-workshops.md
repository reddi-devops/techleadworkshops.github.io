Like many software engineers, I've had lots and lots of side projects, but I think I'm more excited about **Tech Leadership Workshops** than any other. I hope I can share why in this first blog post.

### Everyone Seems to Know There’s a Problem

Today’s cliché is that every business is now in the software business or they won’t be in business in another decade. Everyone in the software business knows how important it is to have strong engineering teams if they want to compete. That’s true whether you’re a startup or a 150 year old financial institution. 

And everyone knows that a strong engineering team is strong because its members can express a full skill spectrum– “hard,” technical skills and “soft,” cultural skills too.

And everyone further knows that you can’t rely on engineering team managers to hire, train, or mentor for that full skill spectrum, as I described it. You’re going to need to enlist some members of the team who can help improve the team’s culture, its agile mindset, its resilience in the face of adversity. Put differently, you need leadership to percolate with the team itself, regardless of job title. 

To me, the 10x engineer exist, to the extent they do, because they can multiply the capabilities of the team – not because of his or her individual contributions. Everyone says they want a 10x engineer, but what they want is an engineer with strong leadership capabilities. I call them tech leads. 

### It’s a Problem That Almost Nobody is Doing Anything About

First, there's almost no common body of knowledge for software engineers who want to take on more leadership. There are almost no books. Patrick Kua from ThoughtWorks wrote a survey book highlighting interviews many tech leads. There’s a handful of blog posts with a long, long tail – some of them dating back to 2008 or earlier. 

There are a million posts about engineering team dynamics, social intelligence, and empathy, but they mostly lay blame for the lack of those things at management’s feet. I’m a manager, and I’m not omniscient, omnipresent, nor am I nearly as good as these posts think I should be at fostering team culture, and I’m a lot better than others I think. 

You won’t find a whole lot out on the conference circuit either. There’s the CalibrateSF conference, which seems quite good (I couldn’t take them up on their invite last year). You might get the occasional leadership or team dynamics session at tech conferences.

So there’s a problem to solve.

### My Contribution: The Tech Lead Workshops

Even if you did read a book or go to a lot of conferences, it probably wouldn’t help much – you need actual practice to learn how to do it well. You need real, live, full bandwidth, high resolution, in person experience. 

Leadership is like public speaking. You can read all you want and listen to all the conference talks you want, but the only way to learn is to do. Toastmasters exists to give you a safe space to practice, for example.

I’d like to do something like Toastmasters (but updated to a Github world) for aspiring tech leads: a safe space where you can come to practice leadership skills before you’re called do it for real, with real lives, and real livelihoods on the line. 

I’m hoping the open source approach will let this scale beyond my ability to do this on the side. By open sourcing the case studies and workshops, you can take them to your organization or Meetup. I hope you’ll join me.

Next post: where I think we need to go, how you can help.
